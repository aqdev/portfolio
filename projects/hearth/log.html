<p>
    This is the SQL I used to create and populate the Hearth Logistics sample dataset in DB Browser for SQLite. 
    All locations are real places I have serviced, and times for stops, travel, and shifts are all
    within realistic ranges based on my experience. I enlisted DeepSeek AI to create the hours and stops data,
    in order to save myself some work. The purpose of this project is to explore how accurate tracking of 
    drivers and equipment could improve operational efficiency, leading to increased productivity and, 
    therefore, revenue.
</p>
<p>
    It's worth noting that I ran into some snags creating the stops data, because they required 
    quite a bit of calculation in order to make sense, which is to say they couldn't overlap per 
    each driver, needed a reasonable travel time between them, and needed to be realistic. It took 
    several tries for the AI to get the formulas working properly, but persistence paid off and I was 
    impressed with its solution.
